Class Constraints
   - Numerators and denominators are unchangeable once set by the constructor.
   - No denominator will be stored as a zero (so the code will never throw an ArithmeticException for division by zero).
   - A fraction is always in reduced form (reduce in the constructor to ensure this)..

            // What data types should these items be?

    /* - Indicates whether this fraction is equal to the specified fraction.
       - Since Fraction is a subclass of Object, it inherits an equals method from Object which takes an Object as an argument.
            - Our new method will override the Object method, so our method has to take an Object argument as well.
            - So, we start the method by making sure the argument is a non-null Fraction, and if so, we cast the argument from Object to Fraction.
            - Then, we compare the numerators and denominators of the fractions.
